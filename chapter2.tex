\chpt{Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease} \label{chpt2:please}

In the chapter, we present the Penn microbiome study of pediatric Crohn's disease. Dysbiosis, which is signified by abnormal composition of intestinal bacteria, is characteristic of Crohn's disease. Disease treatments include dietary changes and immunosuppressive anti-TNF$\alpha$ antibodies as well as ancillary antibiotic therapy, but their effects on microbiota composition are undetermined. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed fecal samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease patients starting therapy with enteral nutrition or anti-TNF$\alpha$ antibodies and reveal the full complement and dynamics of bacteria and fungi during treatment. Bacterial community membership was associated independently with intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and therapy. Antibiotic exposure was associated with increased dysbiosis, whereas dysbiosis decreased with reduced intestinal inflammation. Fungal proportions increased with disease and antibiotic use. Dietary therapy had independent and rapid effects on microbiota composition distinct from other stressor-induced changes and effectively reduced inflammation. These findings reveal that dysbiosis results from independent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotics and shed light on Crohn disease treatments. The work in this chapter has been published and readers who are interested in this work can refer to \citet{lewis2015inflammation, lee2015comparative}.


This project is a collaborative work with Gary Wu (Department of Gastroenterology), Rick Bushman (Department of Microbiology), Jim Lewis (Department of Epidemiology) and people in their teams. They recruited the subjects, collected samples and clinical data, prepared and sequenced the samples. My role in this project is to analyze the data and generate the report.

\section{Introduction}
The human gut microbiota is densely populated by microbes from all three domains of life together with their viruses \citep{Hoffmann:2013gu,Consortium:2012tm,Minot:2011ez}. Crohn's disease results from a pathologic interaction between the mucosal immune system and the environment, particularly the microbes residing in the gut lumen \citep{Sartor, Sartor:2008cs}, and is characterized by dysbiotic gut bacterial composition \citep{Huttenhower:2014ba, Khor:2011ky, Sartor, Sartor:2008cs}. Numerous human genetic loci encoding proteins involved in host immune responses have been linked to Crohn's disease \citep{Jostins:2012iu}, but the impact of these genes on the dysbiosis associated with Crohn's disease is limited \citep{Knights:2014jta}. Rather, dysbiosis is hypothesized to be a response of the microbes, particularly bacteria, to environmental stressors such as the host inflammatory response \citep{Huttenhower:2014ba} and/or the production of electron acceptors that facilitate anaerobic respiration \citep{Winter:2014ed}. Dysbiosis is commonly characterized by an expansion of Proteobacteria and a decrease in Firmicutes, along with a decrease in community richness \citep{nagalingam2012role}. Much less is known about the responses of other domains of microbial life to environmental stressors. Similarly, it is unknown whether dysbiosis resulting from inflammation is rapidly reversible. Patients with Crohn's disease are exposed to antibiotics and dietary changes that are likely to affect the microbiota, but the influence of these factors and their interactions with each other are incompletely understood. 

Antibiotics are often used as an ancillary therapy for Crohn's disease \citep{Khan:2011vo}. However, the main therapies for Crohn's disease includes episodic or chronic immunosuppression with corticosteroids, antimetabolite agents, or antibodies directed against host immune proteins such as tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (anti-TNF) \citep{Borrelli:2006tk, Grover:2013dj, Rutgeerts:2012ul}. The anti-TNF medications are administered parenterally and are not expected to alter the gut microbiota composition directly. An alternative therapy, used predominantly in children, is the defined formula diet, also known as enteral nutrition therapy. Both elemental and polymeric formulae, containing, respectively, amino acids and intact protein, have proved efficacious in treating symptoms and intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease in addition to supporting nutritional needs for growth and weight maintenance \citep{Borrelli:2006tk,Grover:2013dj}. The efficacy of these diets is greatest when used as the exclusive source of nutrition \citep{Grover:2013dj,lee2015comparative}. Dietary therapy has the advantage of avoiding immunosuppression but is difficult to maintain long term. If the mechanism of action of dietary-based therapies were understood, it might be possible to develop less restrictive diets that deliver the same therapeutic benefit. One hypothesis is that diet therapy alters the composition of the gut microbiota in a manner that contributes to the therapeutic benefit, though data supporting this are limited \citep{Gerasimidis:2014gi,Kaakoush:2015hh}.


We reasoned that longitudinal characterization of the gut microbiome of pediatric Crohn's disease patients initiating therapy would allow us to characterize the concurrent effects of intestinal inflammation, antibiotics, and diet on gut microbial community structure. We conducted a longitudinal study of 90 children with Crohn's disease who were initiating treatment with either a defined formula diet or anti-TNF therapy and compared them to 26 healthy control children. We tracked symptoms, mucosal inflammation, and changes in the gut microbiome over an 8-week study period. The gut microbiome was quantified using shotgun metagenomic DNA sequence analysis of longitudinal samples. Dysbiosis was quantified as the distance of each sample from the centroid of samples from healthy controls. Communities partitioned into two distinct clusters based on the bacterial composition, as seen previously \citep{Frank:2007hn, gevers2014treatment}, one of which overlapped the healthy controls. The dysbiotic community was associated with increases in specific fungi, prior antibiotic therapy, and higher concentration of human DNA in feces. By tracking the microbiota composition over the course of therapy, we found that dysbiosis was reduced in response to decreased bowel inflammation, and that inflammation, antibiotic exposure, and diet independently influenced different taxa. Fungi were elevated with disease and antibiotic use, but diminished with diet therapy. Thus while dysbiosis in the gut is common in Crohn's disease, the response of the gut microbiome depends on the environmental stressor.


\section{Clinical outcomes in patients treated with a defined formula diet versus anti-TNF}
Ninety children initiated one of the study therapies (52 anti-TNF; 22 exclusive enteral nutrition [EEN]; 16 partial enteral nutrition with ad lib diet [PEN]) \citep{lee2015comparative}. EEN- and PEN-treated children consumed approximately 90\% and 53\% of daily calories from dietary formulas, respectively. Inflammation was quantified by measuring fecal calprotectin (FCP). Response to therapy was defined as a reduction of FCP to below 250 mg/g because this measure is associated with diminished mucosal inflammation \citep{Lin:2014hm}. Reduction in FCP below 250 mg/g was more common among those receiving anti-TNF (62\%) and EEN (45\%) than PEN (10\%) \citep{lee2015comparative}.



\section{Microbial community patterns in Crohn's disease and healthy controls}
Adequate stool samples were available from 86 individuals to conduct shotgun metagenomic analysis. Samples were collected at four time points: baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks into therapy (Table~\ref{TS1}). We also compared stool samples from 26 healthy children collected in a prior study \citep{wu2011linking} but analyzed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing here. None of the healthy children had received antibiotics in the prior 6 months. DNA was prepared from whole stool, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq paired-end method. After filtering out low-quality, human, and contaminating reads, we were left with $6.5 \times 10^{11}$ bases of microbial DNA sequence for analysis.



We quantified the bacterial taxonomic composition using MetaPhlAn \citep{segata2012metagenomic}. Figure~\ref{Fig21_Microbiome_Cluster_Heatmap} shows a comparison of bacterial lineages in the healthy control subjects and pediatric Crohn's disease cohort prior to initiation of therapy (hereinafter referred to as "baseline"). Figure~\ref{Fig21_Microbiome_Cluster_Heatmap}A shows taxonomic proportions for each sample at baseline with metadata summarized above the heat map (all time points are shown in Figure~\ref{F2S1_heatmap}).

\end{figure*}


After filtering out very-low-abundance genera, comparison of median relative abundances showed 14 of 45 genera differed between children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls (FDR controlled p $<$ 0.05 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Table~\ref{TS2}). The Crohn's patients had reduced relative abundance of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Odoribacter, Akkermansia, Roseburia, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Coprococcus, Dorea, and Ruminococcus and increased abundance of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus and Veillonella. Random forest was used to identify bacterial lineages that best distinguished healthy children from Crohn's patients with active disease, and predicted Crohn's disease and normal with 86\% prediction accuracy. Mostly similar lineages (Prevotella, Odoribacter, Eubacterium, Escherichia, and Faecalibacterium) were found to distinguish the groups.


Community patterns were analyzed using partitioning around medoids with estimation of number of clusters (PAMK) to find the optimal number of clusters, and visualized after multidimensional scaling (MDS) (Figure~\ref{Fig21_Microbiome_Cluster_Heatmap}B). Samples from patients with active Crohn's disease partitioned into two clusters (Figure~\ref{F2S1_heatmap}B): one that was near to the healthy controls (near cluster) and one that clustered separately (far dysbiotic cluster), paralleling previous studies \citep{Frank:2007hn, gevers2014treatment}. Thirty of 45 genera differed in abundance (q $<$ 0.05) between the two clusters (Table~\ref{TS3}). The far dysbiotic cluster was characterized by an increased relative abundance of Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus and reduced relative abundance of Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, Dorea, Blautia, Holdemania, Collinsella, Coprococcus, Odoribater, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Dialister, Eubacterium, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus. Random forest with bacterial abundance had 92\% prediction accuracy for predicting these two clusters. The top five most predictive genera were Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Dialister, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides. 

To make sure the two-cluster pattern and its correlation with human DNA in the previous analysis is not due to artifacts, we repeated the clustering analysis and  MDS analysis at species level as well as using another distance index, numerical Jaccard distance. The analysis at the species level (Figures~\ref{F2S1_heatmap}C and \ref{F2S1_heatmap}D) and analysis using numerical Jaccard distance (Figures~\ref{F21_Numerical_Jaccard_MDS_Merge}A and \ref{F21_Numerical_Jaccard_MDS_Merge}B) yielded similar conclusions. 


In summary, baseline samples clustered into two groups, with the far dysbiotic cluster being more distant from the healthy controls and characterized by altered bacterial composition and lower diversity.





\section{High levels of human DNA in stool correlated with dysbiosis}
In processing the metagenomic DNA from stool, we observed that the proportion of human DNA varied widely (Figure~\ref{Fig21_Microbiome_Cluster_Heatmap}C). The percentage of human reads was low in the healthy controls (mean = 0.87\%, max = 10.1\%, minimum = 0.05\%) relative to patients with active Crohn's disease (mean = 16.6\%, maximum = 94.2\%, minimum = 0.01\%; $p < 5 \times 10^{-11}$), with over 50\% of the sequence reads mapped to human in 49 Crohn's disease samples. Selected DNA samples were tested for human DNA content using QPCR to detect human beta-tubulin-coding sequences (performed by people in Rick Bushman's lab), revealing that the amounts detected were positively correlated with the calls from metagenomic sequencing (r = 0.81 Pearson's correlation, $p = 9.3 \times 10^{-11}$). We hypothesized that the source of human DNA was either epithelial cells or blood shed into feces associated with disease activity.


\section{Analysis of fecal microbial gene pathways}
Next, we studied the functions of the gut microbiome and its association with IBD. We used HUMAnN  \citep{Abubucker:2012fd} to measure the microbial gene and pathway abundance. The gene content of the gut microbiota was compared to assess associations between gene function and dysbiosis (Figure~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}A) . Differences were found between IBD and healthy controls in 42 of 163 pathways examined (Table~\ref{TS4}). Crohn's samples clustered into two groups based on gene pathway data, one of which more closely resembled the healthy controls and one more dysbiotic (Figure~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}B; Table~\ref{TS5}). The clusters separated based on pathway data tracked closely with the near and far clusters defined by bacterial taxonomic representation (Figure~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}B, red and blue colors). 

To guide interpretation, we analyzed the Spearman correlation between bacterial abundance and gene pathway enrichment in these data (Figure~\ref{F2S2_gene_heatmap}A). Pathway data partitioned the bacteria into two notable groups, one including gammaproteobacteria together with Streptococcus and Enterococcus and a second group dominated by Bacteroides and multiple anaerobic Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes typical of healthy gut. Below we propose relationships between specific gene pathways and persistence in the presence of different environmental stressors. However, enrichment may also be due to passenger effects, where outgrowth of specific organisms resulted in enrichment in pathways that were not themselves major contributors to differential fitness. 

Random forest was used to identify those pathways that best discriminated between healthy children and the active Crohn's disease cohort at baseline (Figures~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}C and \ref{F2S2_gene_heatmap}B). Samples membership in the two categories could be predicted with 87\% accuracy using gene pathway data, comparable to the partitioning achieved using bacterial taxonomic data. The top six most notable pathways, higher in the Crohn's samples, were sulfur relay systems, galactose metabolism, biosynthesis of siderophores, glycerolipid metabolism, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism (Table~\ref{TS4}). Similarly, 94 of 163 gene pathways were differentially abundant between the two clusters, 51 with greater representation in the more dysbiotic far cluster (Table~\ref{TS5}). Random forest using gene pathway abundance had 87\% prediction accuracy for classification of the two bacterial clusters (near and far dysbiotic) defined by taxonomic proportions. The five most predictive pathways were glycerophospholipid metabolism, aminobenzoate degradation, sulfur relay system, and glutathione metabolism, which were increased in the far dysbiotic cluster, and selenocompound metabolism, which was decreased in the far cluster. Thirty-three of 42 pathways that were significantly different between Crohn's disease and healthy controls were also significantly different between the two clusters of Crohn's disease, suggesting that they are related primarily to the composition of the dysbiotic microbiota rather than being intrinsic alterations associated with IBD per se.

\section{Fungal community structure} 
We characterized the fungal reads in the metagenomic data by alignment to sequenced fungal genomes, followed by extensive filtering to remove artifacts (performed by people in Rick Bushman's lab). Five fungal taxa were detected in the samples, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clavispora lusitaniae (also known as Candida lusitaniae), Cyberlindnera jadinii (also known as Pichia jadinii and Candida utiliz), Candida albicans, and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Figure~\ref{F23_Fugus}A shows the representation of fungal taxa in healthy controls and Crohn's disease samples at baseline, and the relationship to metadata. All of the fungal taxa were more represented in the samples from Crohn's disease subjects, particularly those in the more dysbiotic far cluster as defined by the bacterial taxonomic analysis (Figures~\ref{F23_Fugus}B-\ref{F23_Fugus}F). Abundance of the different fungi were highly correlated with each other (Spearman correlation 0.66-0.84). Higher fungal proportions in samples also correlated with higher levels of human DNA (Figure~\ref{F23_Fugus}G). Random Forest analysis based on fungal data had 92\% prediction accuracy for classification of normal and baseline Crohn's disease samples. The most predictive fungus was Clavispora lusitaniae. Thus, the five yeasts detected are positively associated with Crohn's disease, particularly in the setting of greater bacterial dysbiosis. Some correlations were observed between bacteria and fungi in the cohort, but these varied between the healthy controls and the two clusters of patients with Crohn's disease (Figures~\ref{F2S3_taxa_fungi_correlation}A-\ref{F2S3_taxa_fungi_correlation}C).

\section{Exploring the baseline clusters defined by bacterial abundance in a multivariate model }
We next explored factors associated with membership in the dysbiotic far cluster at baseline (Figure~\ref{Fig21_Microbiome_Cluster_Heatmap}B). In the multivariable model, use of antibiotics within the preceding 6 months, current use of corticosteroids, and abundance of fungi were independently associated with membership in the far cluster. These data indicate that at least part of the previously described dysbiosis in IBD may be due to antibiotic and corticosteroid exposure and that the dysbiosis extends beyond the bacteria to include fungi. 

Given the association with antibiotics, we further defined the bacterial taxa that distinguished Crohn's disease from healthy controls by analyzing only the subset of patients not treated with antibiotics (Table~\ref{TS6}). Separately, we analyzed the association of antibiotic use and taxonomic representation within the Crohn's disease cohort (Table~\ref{TS7}). Bacterial genera associated with Crohn's disease in the absence of antibiotic use were almost completely different from genera associated with antibiotic use in the Crohn's disease cohort (discussed further below).

\end{figure*}



\section{ Clustering did not predict response to therapy }
Rates of response to treatment were not significantly different among patients in the near or far dysbiotic cluster. Twenty-seven patients (53\%) in the near cluster and nine (45\%) patients in the far dysbiotic cluster achieved a reduction in FCP below 250 mg/g (p = 0.60). Among anti-TNF-treated patients the response rates were 66.7\% and 60\%, respectively (p = 0.74). Too few EEN-treated patients were available for meaningful comparison.

\section{ Dynamics of dysbiosis with treatment }
We categorized sequences from each fecal sample by its Jaccard distance from the centroid of the healthy control samples, providing a quantitative measure of dysbiosis, and then analyzed longitudinal dynamics. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of diet-based therapy is to alter the gut microbiota composition. We thus assessed the bacterial composition at baseline and 1 week into therapy (Figure~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}A). The microbiota composition among the EEN-treated group changed within 1 week of therapy, moving significantly farther from centroid of the healthy controls (relative to baseline p = 0.005 overall, p = 0.02 among responders, p = 0.14 among non-responders). One week after initiation of EEN, abundance of 6 of the 40 genera examined were nominally different at a threshold of p = 0.05 (Haemophilus, Alistipes, Streptococcus, Dialister, Dorea, and Gordonibacter; not significant after correction for multiple comparisons; Table~\ref{TS8}). A similar pattern was not seen among the PEN-treated patients (p = 0.83) or anti-TNF-treated patients (p = 0.02, note anti-TNF-treated group moved closer to healthy centroid within 1 week), suggesting that either there is a dose-dependent effect of enteral nutrition or that fully removing regular table food from the diet influences microbiota composition within 1 week. 

We next used linear regression to examine the independent effects of reduction in FCP, antibiotic exposure, and the degree of dysbiosis at baseline on the final state of the microbial community (Figure~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}B). Given the different microbial response to the three therapies during the first week, analyses were conducted combined and stratified by treatment. At the end of the study, responders (i.e., those with reduction in FCP) were closer to the centroid of the healthy controls than nonresponders after adjusting for antibiotic use and initial degree of distance from the centroid (p = 0.003). Similar patterns were seen for anti-TNF therapy (p = 0.06) and EEN (p = 0.06). There were too few responders to PEN for meaningful analysis. Analysis at the species level yielded generally similar results, but with a more pronounced difference in the composition of responders and non-responders to EEN after 1 week of therapy (p = 0.025), a difference that persisted at week 8 (Figures~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}A and \ref{F2S4_distance_species}B). 

The resolution of dysbiosis was not complete among responders. Among the anti-TNF-treated patients who were responders, 11 taxa differed in abundance from healthy controls at baseline (q $<$ 0.05). At the end of follow-up, nine of these taxa (82\%) remained significantly different at a nominal p $<$ 0.05, and six (55\%) were significant at a q $<$ 0.05 (Klebsiella, Prevotella, Escherichia, Odoribacter, Enterococcus, and Fusobacterium). Thus, clinical response was associated with evolution of communities toward healthy structure (Figure~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}B), consistent with the observation that human DNA levels diminished with successful therapy (q = 0.0002; quantile regression), but normal community structure was not usually fully restored (Figure~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}A). This may be due to continuing environmental stress from the host inflammatory response as indicated by mildly elevated FCP despite response to treatment. An analysis at the species level yielded generally similar conclusions (Figures~\ref{F2S4_distance_species}A and \ref{F2S4_distance_species}B). Fungal colonization was not reduced with successful therapy (p = 0.35; quantile regression).

To explore the independent effect of inflammation on the composition of the gut microbiota, we created separate robust quantile (75\%) regression models adjusted for antibiotic use and treatment modality with fold-change in abundance of individual taxa as the dependent variable. Response to therapy defined as final FCP $<$ 250 mg/g was associated with decrease in Actinomyces (p = 0.0002, q = 0.01) and increase in Lactococcus (p = 0.002, q = 0.046) and Roseburia (p = 0.006, q = 0.084). (Table~\ref{TS9}). Multiple gene pathways were also associated with antibiotic use, treatment, and response (Table~\ref{TS10}).

Distinctive responses of genus-level taxa are summarized in Figure~\ref{F25_summary}, which also indicates the time points queried. Specific bacterial lineages showed increases or decreases in abundance associated with (1) health or Crohn's disease at baseline, (2) antibiotic use in the Crohn's disease cohort at baseline, (3) diet therapy in the Crohn's cohort at week 1, and (4) resolution of inflammation (corrected for antibiotic use) in the Crohn's cohort at week 8. 


Distinctive responses were also seen associated with fungal colonization (Figure~\ref{F25_summary}; Table~\ref{TS11}$\sim$\ref{TS14}). At baseline, Candida, Clavispora, Cyberlindnera, and Kluyveromyces were all enriched in Crohn's samples versus healthy controls (Table~\ref{TS11}). Comparisons between antibiotic-treated versus not treated patients showed enrichment of all these fungi plus Saccharomyces as well (Table~\ref{TS12}). In contrast, after one week of diet therapy, Candida, Clavispora, and Cyberlindnera were all reduced in abundance (Table~\ref{TS13}). Similarly, abundance of Clavispora Cyberlindnera, and Kluyveromyces were significantly reduced from baseline to week 8 only in the EEN-treated group (q $<$ 0.05) and not the anti-TNF-treated group. At week 8, overall response to therapy after adjusting for treatment and antibiotic use was not associated with a change in fungal abundance (Table~\ref{TS14}).

\section{ Discussion }
Here we assess the concurrent effects of inflammation, diet, and antibiotic use on the the gut microbiome in pediatric Crohn's disease. The environmental stresses experienced by Crohn's disease patients were associated with changes in microbial taxonomy that mostly differed among the stressors studied (Figure~\ref{F25_summary}). We observed that patients with Crohn's disease can be categorized into two groups defined by the composition of the bacterial populations, paralleling previous studies based on 16S rRNA gene tag sequencing \citep{Frank:2007hn,gevers2014treatment,Tong:2013bp}. We further showed that dysbiosis involved differences in microbial gene representation, increases in fungal representation, and higher levels of human DNA in stool. Antibiotic exposure, which is common in this population, has also been identified as a risk factor for new onset Crohn's disease \citep{Card:2004tb, Margolis:2010et} and was strongly associated with the dysbiosis observed here. EEN further altered the composition of the gut microbiota, possibly due to elimination of regular table food, despite having a favorable effect on gut inflammation. By our definition, the effect of diet qualifies as dysbiosis, though we note that the changes were distinct from the other stressors studied (Figure~\ref{F25_summary}). Finally, effective therapy with either anti-TNF or EEN reduced, but did not completely eliminate, the dysbiosis present at baseline. Thus, our data demonstrate that diet, antibiotics, and inflammation each independently influence different components of the microbial community.

\caption[Bacterial and fungal genera associated with environmental stressors]{Bacterial and fungal genera associated with environmental stressors. Microbial genera are shown that differed in four comparisons: Crohn's disease versus healthy controls at baseline ("Disease"); antibiotic use at baseline in the Crohn's disease cohort ("Antibiotics"); diet (EEN) or anti-TNF therapy at week 1 ("Diet"); and reduction of inflammation or not at the end of the study at week 8 ("Inflammation"). The time line is shown along the bottom (yellow). Baterial lineages are shown in light blue and fungal lineages in pink. Taxa shown were significantly associated after adjustment for multiple comparisons for Crohn's disease versus healthy controls, for antibiotic use comparisons, and for all fungal comparisons. The bacterial taxa shown for the effect of EEN, and resolution of inflammation were significant at a nominal p value $<$ 0.05 (i.e., without correction for multiple comparisons).

We described two clusters of patients based on microbiota composition, though the data can be characterized as either a continuum or a dichotomous grouping. The two clusters were associated with clinical features such as antibiotic use and human DNA but did not appear to predict response to therapy. Thus, the biologic and clinical significance of the clusters remains to be determined.


There were very few taxa whose abundance was associated with more than one stressor. However, the genus Alistipes was increased with EEN but diminished by antibiotic treatment, raising the possibility that antibiotics antagonize the beneficial effects of EEN. 


The independent effects of antibiotics, diet, and inflammation likely reflect different mechanisms. Antibiotics are direct toxins to bacteria and may facilitate outgrowth of fungi. Changes in diet provide novel substrates supporting bacterial growth. Inflammation may select for bacterial taxa able to live in the setting of oxidative stress. The normal oxygen gradient in the colon influences the composition of the gut microbiota with a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in the microaerobic environment of the mucosal surface \citep{Albenberg:2014bp}. Disruption of the epithelium and bleeding due to active Crohn's disease is expected to lead to greater intraluminal oxygen, which in turn would favor outgrowth of taxa belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum. In addition, some Enterobacteriacaea are known to exploit compounds produced during inflammation as terminal electron acceptors, promoting their outgrowth \citep{Winter:2014ed}.


We observed a rapid change in the composition of the gut microbiota within 1 week of initiating EEN, similar to that observed in other small studies of defined formula diets \citep{Gerasimidis:2014gi} and with alterations in whole-food diets \citep{David:2014cl,wu2011linking}. However, this study was unique in the ability to compare PEN to EEN. A similar change in the microbiota was not observed in children receiving PEN, despite administration of nearly the same amount of enteral formula, suggesting that the exclusion of table foods was the primary determinant in changing the gut microbiota and perhaps mediating the increased effectiveness of EEN \citep{lee2015comparative}. After 1 week of EEN, the composition of the microbiota differed between ultimate responders and non-responders, suggesting measures of the microbiota may be used to predict response to therapy. 


Genes from the category "biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides" (Figure~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}A) were more represented in the more dysbiotic far cluster. This may be due to the response of the gut microbiota to blood in the gut lumen, as indicated by the association with human DNA in stool. Siderophores scavenge iron from the environment. Iron has been linked to an invasive phenotype in bacteria, thereby promoting inflammation \citep{Nairz:2010cf}. Thus, blood associated with active IBD may deliver iron to the gut microbiota, promoting dysbiosis. 


The effect of environmental stress on the gut microbiota extends into the Eukaryotic domain. Others have documented increased richness of fungi in patients with Crohn's disease using older methods but have not linked this directly to specific fungi, environmental stressors, or linked changes in the bacterial microbiota \citep{Ott:2008kj, Richard:2015kk}. In a separate study using sequencing of fungal gene tags, we found that Cyberlindnera jadinii (also known as Pichia jadinii or Candida utilis) was proportionally increased in Crohn's patients \citep{Chehoud:2015ga}, confirming the detection of this lineage here. In this study, four of the five fungi detected (Candida, Clavispora, Cyberlindnera, and Kluyveromyces) showed increased representation in Crohn's disease samples at baseline in the absence of antiboitic use. Independently, antibiotic use was also associated with increased colonization by all five fungi. Diet therapy showed the opposite behavior—after 1 week, fungal colonization was diminished (Figure~\ref{F25_summary}). Thus increased fungal colonization is associated independently with disease and antibiotic treatment and diminished with EEN. The reduction with EEN may be a consequence of lower consumption of fungi in food (Saccharomyces and Cyberlindnera are both found in foods), or due to a change in the microbial environment in the gut with EEN, paralleling the change in bacteria. The importance for pathogenesis is unknown, though we note that anti-Saccharomyces antibiodies are used as a biomarker in IBD \citep{Peeters:2001ba, Prideaux:2012kn, Quinton:1998tj}, and fungi have shown to exacerbate colitis in mouse models \citep{Iliev:2012ko}. 

Cyberlindnera and Candida have been positively associated with bacteria including Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Positive correlation of Candida and Streptococcus has been reported for oral samples from lung transplant recipients \citep{Bittinger:2014hm}, an interaction proposed in medically important mixed biofilms \citep{Metwalli:2013fb}. Possibly antibiotic exposure promotes formation of a mixed community in the inflamed gut, paralleling studies in mice \citep{Dollive:2013cj}. 


The presence of fungi may also have contributed to the metabolic genomic signature associated with IBD (Figures~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}A and \ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}C). Since bacteria do not have phospholipid membranes as in eukaryotic organisms, it may be that the predominance of genes associated with "glycerolipid metabolism" and "glycerol phospholipid metabolism" (Figure~\ref{F22_Pathway_Cluster_Heatmap}C) in Crohn's disease is due to the abundance of fungi in the dysbiotic far cluster. Indeed, with the exception of actinomycetes group, triacylglycerols in bacteria have rarely been described \citep{Alvarez:2002cy}. These same pathways might also be involved in the catabolism of fatty acid lipids through either peroxisomal or mitochondrial boxidation, again, a feature of eukaryotic organisms like yeast \citep{Strijbis:2010gd} and not bacteria. 


The bacterial microbiota among responders became more similar to the healthy controls than the microbiota of non-responders with both anti-TNF and EEN. Anti-TNF therapy is administered parenterally and is not expected to alter the gut microbiome directly, indicating that dysbiosis is likely a consequence of inflammation. However, the bacterial dysbiosis was only partially resolved among responders, and fungal dysbiosis did not resolve. Perhaps complete resolution would occur with longer follow-up along with a reduction in the stressors to the gut microbiota described here. In turn, complete resolution of bacterial and or fungal dysbiosis might have a favorable impact on Crohn's disease \citep{Rajca:2014bi, Samuel:2010en}.

In conclusion, we document that dysbiosis of Crohn's disease extends beyond bacteria to include fungi. The dysbiosis results from a combination of inflammation, antibiotic exposure, and dietary changes, each exerting different impacts on the gut microbiota composition. EEN caused further departure of the composition of the gut bacteria from the pattern of healthy controls within 1 week, likely due to the elimination of table foods, but was effective in reducing inflammation. The extent of dysbiosis diminished with reduction of inflammation by anti-TNF or EEN, consistent with inflammation contributing directly to the dysbiosis. Gene pathway analysis suggested that the gut microbiota responds to gut environmental stressors through the modification of metabolism. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to Crohn's disease, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to each environmental stressor. Future studies should explore whether these effects interact in ways that influence outcome.
